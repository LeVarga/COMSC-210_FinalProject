**Intro/Thesis:**
For our final project we would like to create an application for sports fans. This app would have multifunctionality by allowing the user to create a profile to store their personal information, purchase tickets to games, buy concessions once they’re at the game, buy merchandise for their favorite teams, and save their credit card information to make these purchases go smoother.

**Creating a User Profile:**
To access all the functionality of the app, a user must register for an account that holds basic identification information. To set up an account, the user must have an unique username, a password with complexity of a given length, and first and last name. Once the user logged into their account, tickets and other purchases made through their account will be accessible as history.

**Buying Tickets:**
Once the user has registered for an account, they have the option to purchase a ticket from a list of upcoming games which can be located by looking up the date, location, name of the sport, or names of the teams playing. The app will contain a list of the upcoming games in these categories. The list of data on the sports games will be read from a text file. Once they’ve found the game they want to go to, the app will show available seats and their pricing. The user will be required to select an available seat in order to purchase a ticket to the game. Once they’ve picked their seat and completed the transaction, a randomized confirmation number will be linked to their account, which they can show at the stadium for entry.

**Buying Concessions:**
Once the user is at the game they will be able to look at food/drink options at the stadium. Selecting this function will allow them to view all of the concession vendors and their locations around the stadium. From the list the user will be allowed to view the menu for each individual vendor as well as expected wait time. Once their selection is made it will be added to their cart for checkout. This process will also give the user a randomized confirmation number to show to the vendor which confirms their purchase. 
 
**Buying Merchandise:**
Users can choose their favorite professional sports teams and select from different types of merchandise, such as clothing apparel, sports gear, and collectibles, and add their choices to their cart. Users have the option to receive a randomized confirmation number to show at the merchandise stand to pick up their purchase, or enter their address to have it shipped to them. If they choose for it to be shipped, a shipping fee will be added.

**Final Checkout/Credit Card info:**
Every time a user makes a purchase, they must enter their credit card information and will be presented with the option to save their information to make future purchases faster and more convenient. The application will make sure that they have entered valid credit card information, and if not, prompt for valid info.

**Conclusion:**
This multifunctional app will act as a one stop shop for any user going to their next game. A single source for anything that users might want or need when attending the event from buying their tickets beforehand to concessions and merchandise once they’re at the stadium.
